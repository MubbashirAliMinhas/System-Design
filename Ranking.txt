A Simple ranking system can be made by by checking the feed's user_id and user_type with the user's current pages, followers 
and groups. Also newly matched created post appears at the top with a higher rank and then the older matched post will appear in the
user news feed with a lower rank, if the news feed does not belong to the current user following, these post will then appear at the
very end with the newly created first then the older ones.
